## Making a build

If your developing on the app, and are saving data into the app when creating a build all that data will be transfered to the newly created app. Sometimes this is fine. 

### Basic build

```shell
npm run build
```

### Clean Build

> If you are developing something and have not commited it yet, beware of clean builds it runs `git clean -xdf` and will remove any files not tracked yet. This is good tho so there is no left over data in the app.

```shell
npm run cleanbuild
```
